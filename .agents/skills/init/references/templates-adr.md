## ADR authoring rules

- Title: ≤5 words, matches filename
- Status: `accepted` (decisions already made during Phase 2)
- Context: "New [project type] project using [runtime] + [framework]. Needed to decide [decision area]."
- Decision: chosen option + one-line rationale. List alternatives considered.
- Impact: tradeoffs — what becomes easier or harder because of this decision
